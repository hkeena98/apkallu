Apkalla is a cuneiform language and inscription detection, encoding, and translation system.

Cuneiform is the earliest known writing system in human history. It was a writing system primarily used by ancient Mesopotamian civilizations from the early Bronze age until the beginning in the Common Era, usually written into clay tablets. It has been used in a number of ancient languages such as Akkadian, Sumerian, Babylonian, and Hittite, among others. Due to the expansive use of the writing system throughout ancient Mesopotamia, there are a great number of clay cuneiform tablets in the hands of various museums and in private hands, however many of them have gone undeciphered. In addition to many inscriptions being undeciphered, the time it takes historians to manually detect the native language of an inscription, then translate that inscription, is extraordinary. The goal of Apkallu, an Akkadian word meaning “wise”, is to combine a number of natural language processing and machine learning techniques/technologies to automate the process of inscription translation.
